            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small"><strong>AgVantage works differently to many brokering businesses.</strong> We offer a fee-for-service contract that guarantees you have access to the commodities you need, when you need them.   We work independently to source your commodities at your price and provide you with feedback on your bids.</p>
            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small">When dealing with many producer brokers, a buyer can only gain access to commodities when the broker advises their client they should sell and then their prices are auctioned around the market. AgVantage offers service to buyers all year round based on your individual requirements – we will not auction prices.</p>

                AgVantage’s relationships with producers provide leverage when negotiating your business. Price is important – in fact, price is king – but it’s the power of relationships that give you the edge in this competitive environment. AgVantage’s relationships give you, the buyer, access to producers and the ability to distinguish your company from the competition.
            </p>
            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small">
                Relationships are paramount, and experience shows that producers like dealing with a local, knowledgeable person they know and trust who can present them with a competitive price from a reputable counter-party.  In an increasingly competitive environment, buyers need access to commodities without paying a premium to secure them. Most of the time the cheapest commodities are bought from the producer direct – and this is where relationships are crucial.
