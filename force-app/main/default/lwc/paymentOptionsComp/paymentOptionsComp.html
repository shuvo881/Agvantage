        <h1 class="slds-text-heading_large" style="color: rgb(76, 76, 193);">AgVantage works differently to other commodity brokers.  We have a agreements with certain buyers whereby we are remunerated by them, in other words no invoices to producers.</h1>

            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small">
                For other buyers we work on the traditional commodity broker model in which a service invoice will be sent to the seller.  At the time of pricing up your parcel we will always disclose who the buyer is and who pays the commission.
            </p>
            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small">
                At no time does AgVantage have title of your stock and therefore all payments will come from the buyer as agreed on your contract.
            </p>
            <p class="slds-m-vertical_small">
                We can arrange different payment options to suit your cash flow requirements, and we deal with an increasing number of buyers willing to shorten payment terms. We can also accommodate deferred payments and payment terms that suit your tax situation, including pool payments that provide cash flow over a set time period.
            </p>
